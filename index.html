<p>hello. you may know me as i do content creation and malware analysis and termination. I love cybersecurity, programming and reverse engineering.</p>

<p>im 14 and yet ive recently started engaging in the virtual world. have a chat with me on <a href="https://discord.com/users/1355205031636500605">discord</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-this">what is this?</h3>

<p>this is my biolink to learn more about me. so you should stay tuned for more updates.</p>

<h1 id="how it all started">how it all started
</a></h1>

<p>it all started when i got my first computer. it was a rustbox. literally. it was just upgraded from windows vista, intel core i2, 2gb ddr3.
  in basic terms, it was agonising. i was 11 at the time so i would usually play website games or roblox (20 fps). as you might of guessed through basic human intelligence
i could not play popular games back then available through computers. but as my father would work using his computer i was fascinated. i wanted to know how it worked and
not to be perplexed throughout, considering computing is a very tubular and confusing subject.</p>

<h1 id="firstsight">first sight</a></h1>

<p>the first major step to my small career. uncover it. it was around october of 2024. i was chilling through youtube, when i watch NTTS's one discord video. 
  as the so called skid i used to be it was a pysilon video. i was so amazed throughout the general aspects of a rat and how c2's can connect through RAT's. 
  i started to learn more about these discord affiliated RAT's and how it works. until i see <a href="https://youtube.com/@144braincells">144braincells</a> and intelligent
  backend developer completely nuking a pysilon gooning server. it was hilarious. and interesting. i joined their server as the alias aphid (old username). 
  and gave malcious files to warfin and 144. the server had around 80 members. i remember sitting back and watching 144 nuke a bollocks solara server ratting 
  inoccent kids and teens going through life. 
</p>

<h1 id="scamreports"><a href="https://discord.gg/e56KDAJJf7">scamreports</a></h1>

<p>scamreports was my first ever project. i made it with a fellow underaged german (cybr)who first attempted to rat me with discord rat 2.0
  eventually warfin persuaded me to be fine with him as he "changed". as this seemed good, once we had around 30ish members to our surprise we got 2 boosts.
  i was overly excited as i never received any server boosts. cybr was sad. he blamed the boosters for boosting our server and not his. this partly 
  represented his ego and general jealousy of greed. since then id prevented trusting him for this small act of personality. besides a couple weeks later
  he would spam gore and porn. it was diabolical considering his age. 13. later i banned him as i would never expect this. the trans booster who
  said he would boost my server to level 3 if we continue running this community LEFT and blammed for being "unfair" and so left confused since. 
  to their surprise weeks later my server peaked. i had around one thousand members that joined via my youtube. it was great however id come 
  across some degenerates; such as san. san was an admin as i hosted a giveaway whoever gave me nitro would get admin. this so called admin
  would ask people for their cc's and be a total creep skidding all his code all at the age of 10 i reported him and got his account banned
  for generally being underage and a discord average degenerate o needs to go outside and think of what he is doing. however i faced a different 
  complete and utter retard when a bisexual so called "120braincells" who glazed me wanted to affiliate and engage with me. this bisexual weirdo
  had a bio link service as he never started a discord server on it i requested to become a developer and make this site big. it all went great
  i created the logo the server and everything. for that time he was known as the site developer and i was the advertisement and server developer.
  nothing wrong occured until Aspect from the exposing community would begin a DDOS. this DDOS would BSOD 120braincells many times. to the point
  where 120 would get blackmailed into giving me skid role and wipe me from the team for no reason. as 120 is a puupet and chatgpt unintelligent
  fucktard he did so. as a normal developer he could of shut down the site and add security and better backend protection for obvious reasons.
  however this wasnt the case. also mentioning cybr, he was convicted of using xworm and already mentioned discord rat. he is a <a href="https://youtube.com/@cybr08">content creator</a>
  who uploads cringe youtube content for youtube shorts. honestly these 2 made me lose braincells.
